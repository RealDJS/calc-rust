## Overview

**Project Title**: Rust Calculator

**Project Description**: Calculate output from user input

**Project Goals**:

- balance work with other classes.
- become familiar with Rust programming.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. **Install Rust and Cargo:** Download rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. **Clone the repository:** In your terminal, use `git clone https://github.com/RealDJS/calc-rust`
3. **Build the Project:** Go to your project directory in the terminal and run `cargo build` to compile the project.

## Instructions for using the software:

1. **Run the Program:** Run `cargo run` in the terminal while in the project directory.
2. **Enter Calculations:** Enter one digit, an operator (`*`,`/`,`+`,`-`), and one digit.
3. **View Results:** Calculator displays the result.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - you can run this in the terminal without an IDE, but using an IDE can make it easier to access.
